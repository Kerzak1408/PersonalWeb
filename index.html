			  <p>Structured CV in <a href="Documents/Lubomir_Ohman_CV_en.pdf">this PDF</a>.</p>
			  <h2>Education</h2>
			  <p>
				<b>Master in Artificial Intelligence</b> at Charles University in 
				Prague. (started in October 2016, expected graduation in June 2018)
			  </p>
			  <p>
				<b>Bachelor in Computer Science</b> at Charles University in Prague. 
				(started in October 2013, graduated in September 2016)
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Spent a semester at University of Padua as an Erasmus student. 
				(from March 2017 to July 2017)
			  </p>
			  <h2>Work experience</h2>
			  <p>
				<b>C# developer</b> at Eplan Solutions from August 2016 to February 2017.
				Implemented new features and fixed bugs in a program dedicated to model
				and design the wire harnesses in 3D environment. Team Foundation Server
				was used as a tracking system.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				<b>Junior Java developer</b> at Unicorn Solutions from July 2015 to September 2015.
				Participated in development of internal Information System.
			  </p>
			  <h2>Open-source portfolio</h2>
			  <p>
				<b>Fruitons</b> is an online multiplayer turn-based game that was
				created for a university subject called Software Project. The program 
				was created by the team of 4 people I lead. All the projects are available
				at our <a href="http://prak.mff.cuni.cz:7990" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>,
				the game itself has its own 
				<a href="http://prak.mff.cuni.cz:8050/fruiton/" target="_blank">website</a>.
				As for the programming languages, there were used C# (in Unity3D), Haxe and
				Java. For the efficient build process, Tomcat, Artifactory and Bamboo were used and
				as a tracking system there was Jira.
			  <p>
			  <p>
				<b>Heist (in progress)</b> is how I call the program for my Master's thesis. It's
				purpose is to enable modeling environments of security objects and to create
				artificial burglars that try to rob the valuable things inside them.
				It is able to move inside the modeled environment as a security guard and detect the burglars.
				The target user of the application is a security guards trainer that would
				model the desired environment and train his trainees using the program. Source
				code is available at my <a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408/SecurityGame" target="_blank">Github</a>.
				It is written developed in C# using Unity3D.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Other public projects I created are available on my
				<a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408" target="_blank">Github</a>
				as well. There is a <a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408/cook_for_me_server" target="_blank">Java server</a>
				for <a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408/cook_for_me_client" target="_blank">Android client</a>,
				forming shared economy cooking application. In addition, Github contains my 
				<a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408/HearthstoneAI" target="_blank">Bachelor thesis</a>,
				Artificial Intelligence for Hearthstone in Python. Remaining two projects,
				<a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408/Hungry-Birds" target="_blank">Hungry birds</a> and 
				<a href="https://github.com/Kerzak1408/Lopt" target="_blank">Lopt</a>, are both small games 
				written in Unity3D.
			  <p>
			  <h2>Technical skills summary</h2>
			  <p>
				Highly skilled in C#, Java and Python on both commercial and university levels.
				University experience with Haxe, C++, Pascal, MAtlab, XML technologies, HTML,
				CSS, SQL, UML, Haskell, Prolog, Artifactory, Bamboo and Tomcat.
				Knowledgeable in Ruby, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, Mongo DB.
				Familiar with Windows, Linux, Android, TCP/IP.
			  </p>
			  <h2>Team skills<h2>
			  <p>
				SCRUM, JIRA, TFS, Git, Slack.
			  </p>
			  <h2>Programming motto<h2>
			  <p>
				It is much harder and much more important to learn how to
				think analytically than to know all the current technologies.
				That technologies will be out-of-date in a few years, the mind
				that can think analytically will adapt and will never be out-of-date.
